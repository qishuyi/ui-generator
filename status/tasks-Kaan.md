1- Collaborated with team members in formalizing Requirements & Specifications

2- Aided in the design and the implementation of the iterative prompting workflow

3- Tried various alternatives for iteratively prompting various GPT APIs to build a pipeline that returns more optimal outputs to the user, especially in cases where the input data is missing from the user or the user expects more detail in the returned output.

4- Worked on prompt engineering for the initial and iterative inputs to the GPT APIs obtained from the user’s input.

5- Helped present the project status during and at the end of the semester in class. 

6- Collaborated mainly with Nolan, Shuyi, and Yajie.
